Chapter 2    

#[Chapter 2 Algebra](Algebra.md)

The rules of algebra tell us how to manipulate math expressions. By observing and working with the structure of expressions, we can simplify them, and thus compute their values more easily. In this chapter we’ll learn the **general rules that apply to all math expressions**. Knowing these rules will equip you with a powerful toolbox of tricks you can apply to any problem you might face.

In[Section 1.1](part0001_split_001.md), we learned how to _isolate_ the unknown ![x](00015.jpeg) in equations, which is by far the most important technique for solving equations. In this chapter we’ll learn a few more techniques, including how to _simplify_, _expand_, and _factor_ expressions. Together, these techniques are called _algebra_, from the Arabic _al-jabr_ meaning “reunion of broken parts.”

In[Section 2.2](part0002_split_002.md), we’ll use algebra to derive a general formula for solving quadratic equations of the form ![ax^2+bx+c=0](00340.jpeg). Knowing how to solve quadratic equations is really important because they show up all over the place.

Alright! Are you ready for algebra? Let’s get started!

#[Concept maps](part0000_split_011.md)

The diagrams below show all the topics and concepts covered in this book. Topics are shown in rectangular boxes. Concepts are shown in bubbles with rounded corners. Note the numerous connections.

Figure 1: The first chapter of the book covers essential concepts like numbers, number representations, equations, and functions.

Figure 2: In[Chapter 2](Algebra.md) we’ll learn about the rules of algebra, which codify what we’re allowed to do with math expressions.

You can annotate the concept maps with your current knowledge of each concept to keep track of your progress. Add a single dot (![\bullet](00004.jpeg)) next to all concepts you’ve heard of, two dots (![\bullet\bullet](00005.jpeg)) next to concepts you think you know, and three dots (![\bullet\!\bullet\!\bullet](00006.jpeg)) next to concepts you’ve used in exercises and problems. By collecting some dots every week, you’ll be able to move through the material in no time at all.

If you don’t want to mark up your book, you can download a printable version of the concept maps here:[`bit.ly/mathcmap`](./mathcmap.md).

Figure 3: Visual thinking plays a very important role in mathematics. In[Chapter 4](./Coordinate systems.md) we’ll learn about the Cartesian plane, which is a two-dimensional coordinate system used to represent points, vectors, and function graphs. Then in[Chapter 6](Geometry.md) we’ll learn about the fundamental geometric shapes like triangles, pyramids, cones, circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. We’ll also dedicate several sections to familiarizing ourselves with trigonometry, trigonometric functions, and trigonometric identities.

Figure 4: In[Chapter 7](Vectors.md), we’ll use our algebra and geometry skills to learn about vectors and vector operations. In[Chapter 8](./Extra topics.md), we’ll discuss math applications and formal math methods like proofs.

#[Chapter 5 Functions](Functions.md)

Learning math is like learning a new language. One of the most useful ideas you can learn in the language of math is the concept of a function. If numbers and variables correspond to nouns, functions correspond to verbs. Specifically, functions codify relations between variables; any relationship between two variables can be expressed as a function. This makes functions a powerful tool for modelling real-world situations.

In this chapter we’ll learn some important math verbs. We’ll start with some general theory about functions, then catalogue the most important functions that occur in everyday life, in scientific modelling, and in business. We’re building your vocabulary of math action verbs so you’ll be able to get in on the action.

In[Section 5.1](part0005_split_001.md) we’ll introduce the main concepts used to characterize functions: the function’s domain and image, the function’s graph, and the function’s values.[Section 5.2](part0005_split_002.md) serves as a reference manual for 10 functions of central importance in math, science, and engineering. In[Section 5.3](part0005_split_003.md) we’ll observe how translation and scaling transformations affect the functions’ graphs.

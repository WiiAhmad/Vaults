If you look carefully, you’ll find mathematical patterns all around you: complex patterns like the water waves on the surface of a lake, medium-complexity patterns like the up-and-down oscillations of a mass suspended on a spring, and basic patterns that occur in all numbers and geometric shapes.

This is a book about basic math patterns. The goal is to introduce you to fundamental building blocks like numbers, expressions, functions, algebra, and geometry. Understanding basic math concepts will provide you with a common core of tools that you can use in diverse fields like physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, engineering, and business.

Thinking like a mathematician means being able to notice the patterns everywhere around you. That’s what mathematicians do all day—seriously! First you _observe_ a pattern; then you try to _describe_ the pattern (this is usually where the equations and formulas come in); finally you _use_ the pattern to achieve some practical outcome. Would you believe me if I told you that a few equations scribbled on a paper napkin can predict the outcome of a quantum physics experiment, calculate the yield of a chemical reaction, predict the growth rate of bacteria, save a patient’s life, build a bridge, and maximize the profits of a startup?

Do I have your attention? I hope at this point you’re interested in learning at least a little bit of math. Or perhaps you still feel kind of weird about reading a math book, and extra weird about reading a math book by choice, without someone forcing you to read it. What kind of trouble are you getting yourself into?

Relax. Math is no trouble. Learning math is not something to worry about or foresee as difficult. Math is not some sort of obstacle you have to jump over in one shot. Learning math is more like climbing a mountain. It’s up to you to choose the pace of your climb. By investing some time in reading and solving exercises, everyone can gradually make it up the mountain.

The trick to learning math is to redefine what math means to you. Dear reader, trust me on this one: math does not involve memorization and rote calculations! That’s arithmetic. It’s great if you’re fast at adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, but real math is so much more than that. For example, learning some basic algebra rules will allow you to simplify complicated expressions by rewriting them as equivalent but shorter expressions, so by the time you start plugging in the numbers you have a lot less arithmetic to do. The more algebra you learn, the less arithmetic you’ll need to do. What? We learn more math in order to do less math? Yes, that’s pretty much the whole point of the subject. Knowing how to recognize abstract patterns, how to describe them precisely, and how to use them to simplify problems turns out to be a very useful skill set.

In addition to being a useful tool for learning other sciences, learning math is interesting on its own. There will be some beautiful views at the end of each climb up the math mountains.

### Guide to the math mountains

This book is your guide for the first part of your journey in the math mountains. Math concepts like numbers, equations, functions, algebra, and geometry are the first peaks you must climb on your way to the major math and science mountains.

In[Chapter 1](./Numbers, variables, and equations.md), we’ll start by defining fundamental math ideas including numbers, variables, equations, and functions. These are the main building blocks of math, and we’ll use them throughout the book. Readers who are new to mathematics should read[Chapter 1](./Numbers, variables, and equations.md) carefully and invest the time needed to solve the exercises.

Algebra! Yes, there, I said it. In[Chapter 2](Algebra.md) we’ll learn the rules of algebra, which consist of various simplifications, reductions, and expansions we can perform on math expressions. Learning algebra by memorizing a bunch of rules is a very difficult task. Instead, you can think of algebra as a language. Algebra techniques are _verbs_ that we apply to math expressions. To expand the expression ![a(b+c)](00009.jpeg) means to write the expression as ![ab+ac](00010.jpeg). To factor the expression ![ax+ay+az](00011.jpeg) is to write it as ![a(x+y+z)](00012.jpeg). To learn algebra you’ll need to learn some new nouns: _variable_, _term_, _factor_, _expression_, _equation_. You’ll also need to become familiar with the algebra verbs: _to solve_ (equations), _to factor_, _to simplify_, _to expand_ (expressions), _to complete the square_ (in a quadratic expression), etc.

Are you still with me, dear reader? I know the prospects of learning algebra might not seem like the most exciting thing ever, and I’m not going to lie to you and say it will be easy to develop your expression-simplifying skills, but the payoff is totally worth it.

In[Chapter 3](./Exponents and logarithms.md) we’ll discuss exponents and logarithms in detail. For instance, the expression ![a^x](00013.jpeg) means to multiply ![a](00014.jpeg) by itself ![x](00015.jpeg) times. Exponents have some interesting properties, which we’ll spend some time exploring. We’ll also discuss the logarithmic function ![\log_a(x)](00016.jpeg), which is the inverse function of the exponential function ![a^x](00013.jpeg).

In[Chapter 4](./Coordinate systems.md) we’ll discuss the Cartesian plane, which allows us to visualize math concepts like points, vectors, and geometric shapes. We can also use the Cartesian plane to plot function graphs, which are visual representations of how functions behave for all inputs.[Chapter 5](Functions.md) is dedicated to the study of functions. We’ll introduce important new vocabulary for describing functions’ inputs, outputs, and other properties. We’ll build a catalogue of the 10 most important functions for math and scientific modelling. We’ll also discuss how to combine, modify, and transform basic functions in order to form composite functions with various desirable properties.

The subject of geometry deals with shapes, transformations, distances, areas, and volumes. In[Chapter 6](Geometry.md) we’ll learn about geometry, and discuss various formulas for lines, circles, cylinders, spheres, and other shapes. We’ll also discuss trigonometry—the study of the relative lengths of the sides of right-angle triangles.

In[Chapter 7](Vectors.md) we’ll discuss vectors, which are used to describe directions in space. Vectors are useful for science calculations, computing, statistics, machine learning, and myriad other domains.

In[Chapter 8](./Extra topics.md) we’ll discuss various supplementary math topics. We’ll see how to solve systems of linear equations, how to compute compound interest, and learn a bit about proofs and set notation. Learning set notation [Section 8.3](part0008_split_003.md)) is a key foundation for studying more advanced math topics.

The book concludes with a sizeable set of problems [Chapter 9](./Practice problems.md)). Take note, dear reader: math is not a spectator sport. Reading math is not enough—you must also practice your skills by solving problems.

### Use the maps

The concept maps on pages 1 and 3 show an overview of the concepts and topics we’ll discuss in the book. Note the numerous connections between concepts. Understanding these connections is the key to understanding math: math isn’t a random bunch of facts, but an interconnected network of ideas.

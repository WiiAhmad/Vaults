##[Conclusion](part0010_split_001.md)

I’ll conclude with some words of warning about technological dependence. Computer technology is very powerful and everywhere around us, but we must not forget that computers are merely calculators that depend on human commands to direct them. This means it’s important for you to learn how to do math “by hand” first, in order to know how to instruct computers to do the math for you.

I don’t want you to use the tricks you learned in this tutorial to avoid learning how to do math and blindly rely on `SymPy` to do math calculations for you. That’s not a good idea! I’ll be very disappointed if you use `SymPy` to skip the “intellectual suffering” necessary to learn the new math concepts like numbers, equations, functions, etc. That’s what math is all about—understand math concepts and the relationships between concepts. The part that is about rote memorized of math calculations procedures that you should have learned at school is not important at all. The tedious and repetitive math calculations is precisely what can be “outsourced” to `SymPy`.

To solve problems in math (or physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) the most important things are to: A) define the variables relevant for the problem, B) draw a diagram, and C) clearly set up the problem’s equations in terms of the variables you defined. With these steps in place, half the work of solving the problem is already done! Computers can’t help with these important, initial modelling and problem-specific tasks—only humans are good at this stuff. Once you set up the problem (A, B, C), `SymPy` can help you breeze through any subsequent calculations that might be necessary to obtain the final answer.

Most of the big math and science discoveries were made using pen and paper, which shows that scribbling on paper is a useful as a tool for thinking. With what you learned about `SymPy`, you now have access to the combination of pencil and paper for thinking and `SymPy` for calculating. It’s a very powerful combination! What is a real-world problem you’d like to solve? Try modelling the problem using math equations and see what happens. Go out there and do some science!

#[Chapter 1 Numbers, variables, and equations](./Numbers, variables, and equations.md)

In this chapter we’ll introduce the fundamental building blocks of math: numbers, variables, equations, and functions. Learning about the basics will establish a solid foundation for all other topics that are to come.

We’ll start by learning a general procedure for solving equations. This is a fundamental skill you’ll develop throughout the book, starting in[Section 1.1](part0001_split_001.md) and expanding as you learn about more advanced types of equations and solution techniques. In[Section 1.2](part0001_split_002.md) we’ll define the different types of numbers that exist, then discuss number representations in[Section 1.3](part0001_split_003.md). In[Section 1.4](part0001_split_004.md) we’ll learn how to use variables like ![k](00017.jpeg) and ![x](00015.jpeg) to represent unknowns in equations.

We’ll then discuss functions and function inverses in[Section 1.5](part0001_split_005.md). A function describes a transformation between an input variable ![x](00015.jpeg) and a corresponding output variable ![y](00018.jpeg). The inverse function describes the same transformation in the opposite direction, treating ![y](00018.jpeg) as the input and ![x](00015.jpeg) as the output. By learning how to apply functions and function inverses to solve equations, you’re taking one giant step toward acquiring math superpowers. Overall, your knowledge of numbers, variables, equations, and functions will allow you to solve many types of problems on the journey ahead.

#[Chapter 4 Coordinate systems](./Coordinate systems.md)

Numbers have a dual nature: they’re simultaneously abstract mathematical concepts and concrete real-world quantities. The number four corresponds to the abstract concept of “fourness” that is shared by all groups of four objects, but four can also be represented as the length of a four-metre-long wooden pole. This dual nature of numbers is what makes them so useful: we can use numbers and algebra to solve real-world problems, and also visualize abstract algebra problems in terms of real-world lengths. If you want to know the combined length of a four-metre pole and a two-metre pole, you can perform the calculation using numbers inside your head, without needing to move any real poles. Alternatively, you can learn about the abstract concepts of addition and multiplication by manipulating physical objects[1](part0004_split_001.md)

It is possible to add more “dimensions” to the correspondence between numbers and lengths. The Cartesian plane is a two-dimensional _coordinate system_ that assigns a pair of coordinates ![(x,y)](00630.jpeg) to every point in a two-dimensional plane. In this chapter we’ll discuss this important visualization tool that will support your understanding of functions [Chapter 5](Functions.md)), geometry [Chapter 6](Geometry.md)), and vectors [Chapter 7](Vectors.md)).

Many important math ideas can be expressed visually as two-dimensional pictures, geometric shapes, and curves. The same math ideas can also be described by abstract math concepts like numbers and equations. Coordinate systems serve as the bridge between the space you can visualize and the space of abstract math concepts like coordinates and equations.

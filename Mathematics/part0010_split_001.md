Chapter 10    

##[Conclusion](part0010_split_001.md)

We covered many fundamental concepts during this hike in the math mountains. We started with basic math ideas like variables, expressions, and equations, and then moved into algebra—hopefully you’ll agree with me that algebra is not as scary as some people think, right? We covered many other scary topics like exponents and logarithms, and you made it through unscathed. We even tackled more advanced topics like functions, vectors, complex numbers, proofs, and set notation. Congratulations on powering through this intensive math bootcamp!

The only way to truly understand math is to apply math concepts to solving problems. You don’t get points for memorizing rules, formulas, and equations; only when you learn how to _use_ the equations will you truly “own” the math. Math is not a spectator sport! If you’re reading this book without solving the practice problems, you’re getting a bad deal. If you haven’t attempted to solve the problems in[Chapter 9](./Practice problems.md), you need to turn back and give them a shot.

My intention with this book was to give you a solid, basic understanding of many mathematical concepts, explained quickly and simply so you wouldn’t get bored. However, it’s possible that the book’s fast pace led to some gaps in the coverage of the material. Let me know if you find any parts of the book that lack clarity or are missing explanations. Send me an email if you find a confusing explanation, a missing definition, or an equation you think is wrong. You can reach me at [`ivan@minireference.com`](./mailto_ivan@minireference.com.md). The book’s relative errorlessness is thanks to the many typo fixes, bug reports, and helpful suggestions I receive from readers like you.

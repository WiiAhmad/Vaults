### [Why this book?](part0000_split_012.md)

Math is a beautiful subject with many practical applications. Yet many people feel uncomfortable around math. Some even claim to “hate” math and try to avoid the subject. Countless adults are living with _math phobia_. That’s too bad because learning math opens many doors to understanding concepts in science, computing, music, and business. Math is also useful for accomplishing day-to-day tasks.

### [Why learn math?](part0000_split_012.md)

Math is a universal language for describing patterns and shapes. Math is everywhere around us. When you learn math, you’ll be able to see the equations behind real-world phenomena, and then use these equations to predict the future. How cool is that? Learning math will also help you make better daily decisions like avoiding predatory loans, estimating times and distances when travelling, double-checking calculations in contracts and bills, and forecasting the cash flow of your business. Math is not just for scientists and engineers—_everyone_ benefits from knowing math the same way everyone benefits from knowing how to read and write.

### [Is this book for you?](part0000_split_012.md)

This book is written for adult learners who think they suck at math and feel uncomfortable around numbers and equations. Whether you hate math because of bad experiences, feel disheartened at the sight of equations, or simply don’t see the point of learning math, this book has something to offer you. It’s time to reconnect with this beautiful subject.

This book will be useful for everyone who wants to learn math. High school students can quickly learn the material they need for their classes. University students can use the book to review and prepare for more advanced subjects like calculus, statistics, and linear algebra. Parents who want to help their kids with homework can depend on this book to refresh their math skills.

### How are we going to do this?

This book approaches math by showing you the connections between concepts. Learning math does not require memorizing facts and equations. It’s not about how many equations you know, but about knowing how to get from one equation to another. Consult the concept maps on pages 1 and 3 to see all the topics covered in the book and how they are interconnected.

Each section in this book is a short tutorial that covers one math topic with precise definitions, illustrative examples, and concise explanations. By progressing through the chapters and sections of this book, you’ll develop your math knowledge step by step, with each new layer of understanding building upon the previous ones. The book covers numbers, sets, variables, equations, algebra, functions, geometry, trigonometry, and also math applications to personal finance. If it’s useful math, we’ve got it covered! To ensure that you _really_ grasp the material, the book provides numerous exercises and practice problems (see[Chapter 9](./Practice problems.md)). You’ll find the answers to all the exercises and problems in Appendix[1](./XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.md) (page 1).

Whether you’re a student, a parent, or an adult learner, we’ve got a book for you that will help you level-up in math.

### About the author

I have been tutoring math and physics for more than 17 years. Through this experience, I learned to break complicated ideas into smaller, interconnected chunks that are easy to understand. I think the best way to teach math is to clearly define concepts and show the paths that connect them. When learners know the basic vocabulary and are able to find their way in a new mathematical domain, the battle against _math phobia_ is already half won.

#[Chapter 8 Extra topics](./Extra topics.md)

Learning all of mathematics would require several lifetimes. There is so much to learn: applied math, abstract theoretical math, numerical methods, and many other subfields and specialties. It’s up to you to choose how much you want to learn. As an adult learner there will be no exams to force you to study, so if you’re learning something it’s because you _want_ to know!

Out of the thousands of possible math topics you could learn next, I’ve selected a shortlist of three important topics to get you started. In[Section 8.1](part0008_split_001.md) we’ll explore how to solve equations with multiple unknowns. Specifically, we’ll focus on systems of ![k](00017.jpeg) linear equations that contain ![k](00017.jpeg) unknowns. For example, the _system of equations_

![\begin{align*}  1s + 2t & =  5 \\  3s + 9t & =  21  \end{align*}](01859.jpeg)

consists of two equations that contain two unknowns: ![s](01799.jpeg) and ![t](00349.jpeg). There is a systematic procedure you can follow to combine the equations and reduce the problem to a single equation with a single unknown

![\begin{align*}  \; \; \; \; \; \; 3t & = 6,  \end{align*}](01860.jpeg)

which you know how to solve. In the end, we find the unknowns ![s](01799.jpeg) and ![t](00349.jpeg) that satisfy both equations are ![s=1](01861.jpeg) and ![t=2](01862.jpeg).

In[Section 8.2](part0008_split_002.md), we’ll learn about the compound interest calculations used by banks to compute the interest owed on loans. It’s important to understand the math so you can calculate the cost of borrowing for different interest rates and compounding methods. This topic is particularly relevant for students who are considering taking out student loans. Think of this math knowledge as financial self-defence.

Finally, in[Section 8.3](part0008_split_003.md), we’ll introduce sets and set notation. Mathematicians often use symbols like ![\in](01863.jpeg) (element of), ![\subset](01864.jpeg) (subset of), ![\forall](01865.jpeg) (for all), and ![\exists](01866.jpeg) (there exists), to make very concise math statements and definitions. We managed to get through the entire book without the need for these “alien symbols,” but knowing set notation is important for your future math studies. Most advanced math textbooks assume readers are familiar with these symbols, so it’s a good idea to know what the symbols mean.

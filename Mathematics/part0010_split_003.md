##[Further reading](part0010_split_003.md)

You’ve reached the end of this book, but you’re only at the beginning of the journey of mathematical discovery. There are many things left for you to learn about. Below are some recommendations of subjects you might find interesting.

###[Newtonian mechanics](part0010_split_003.md)

Newton’s laws of physics provide an excellent example of the scientific approach to understanding and modelling the world around us. Using a few basic laws, it’s possible to build accurate models for the motion of objects in terms of concepts like position, velocity, acceleration, momentum, and energy. It’s no surprise mechanics is a foundational subject of science.

Since you know basic math, it will be easy for you to understand the laws of physics. Indeed, most physics laws are expressed as mathematical equations. If you know how to manipulate equations and solve for the unknowns in them, then you already know half of physics. If you previously avoided this subject out of fear, now would be a great time to revisit it. Learning physics is an excellent source of _knowledge buzz_.

By learning how to solve complicated physics problems, you’ll also develop your analytical skills. Later, you can apply these skills to other areas of life. Even if you don’t go on to study science, the expertise you develop in solving physics problems will help you tackle complicated problems in general.

###[Calculus](part0010_split_003.md)

Calculus is the language of quantitative science. Many of the fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, biology, and economics are expressed in the language of calculus. A solid grasp of this subject is essential for anyone interested in pursuing university-level studies in science, engineering, or business.

The new knowledge you’ll develop in calculus involves analyzing the properties of functions. You’ll learn to describe how functions change over time (derivatives), and how to calculate the total amount of a quantity that accumulates over a time period (integrals). The language of calculus will allow you to speak precisely about the different properties of functions, and better understand their behaviour. You will learn how to calculate the slopes of functions, how to find their maximum and minimum values, how to compute their integrals, and other tasks of practical importance. In addition to its practical applications, learning calculus will also expose you to the concept of infinity. Calculus thinking requires understanding infinitely small numbers, infinitely large numbers, and computations with an infinite number of steps.

If you liked the math in this book, I encourage you to continue your journey with the **No Bullshit Guide to Math & Physics**, which will teach you the topics of mechanics, differential calculus, and integral calculus in an integrated manner, highlighting the connections between them, and discussing their applications.

###[Linear algebra](part0010_split_003.md)

Learning linear algebra will open many doors for you. You need linear algebra to understand statistics, computer graphics, machine learning, quantum mechanics, and many other areas of science and business.

Here’s a little preview. Linear algebra is the study of vectors ![\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n](01554.jpeg) and linear transformations ![T:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m](02333.jpeg). Linear transformations are _vector functions_ that obey the linear property ![T(\alpha \vec{v}_1 + \beta\vec{v}_2) = \alpha T(\vec{v}_1) + \beta T(\vec{v}_2)](02334.jpeg). Using the standard notation for functions, we write ![T(\vec{x})=\vec{y}](02335.jpeg) to show the linear transformation ![T](01950.jpeg) acting on an input vector ![\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n](02336.jpeg) to produce the output vector ![\vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m](02337.jpeg). Every linear transformation ![T](01950.jpeg) can be _represented_ as a matrix ![A_T \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}](02338.jpeg), which is an array of numbers with ![m](00053.jpeg) rows and ![n](00054.jpeg) columns. Computing ![T(\vec{x})](02339.jpeg) is equivalent to computing the matrix-vector product ![A_T\vec{x}](02340.jpeg). Because of the equivalence between linear transformations and matrices, we can also say that linear algebra is the study of vectors and matrices.

Vectors and matrices are used all over the place! If your knowledge of high-school math gave you modelling superpowers, then linear algebra is the vector-upgrade that teaches you how to build models in multiple dimensions.

###[Probability](part0010_split_003.md)

Probability distributions are a fundamental tool for modelling non-deterministic behaviour. A discrete random variable ![X](00269.jpeg) is associated with a probability mass function ![p_X(x) \eqdef \textrm{Pr}(\{ X = x \})](02341.jpeg), which assigns a “probability mass” to each of the possible outcomes of the random variable ![X](00269.jpeg). For example, if ![X](00269.jpeg) represents the outcome of the throw of a fair die, then the possible outcomes are ![\mathcal{X}=\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}](02342.jpeg) and the probability mass function has the values ![p_X(x)=\frac{1}{6}](02343.jpeg), ![\forall x \in \mathcal{X}](02344.jpeg).

Probability distributions and random variables allow us to model random processes like the roll of a die. We can’t predict the exact outcome when two dice ![X_1](02345.jpeg) and ![X_2](02346.jpeg) are rolled, but we can predict the probability of different outcomes. For example, the “pair of sixes” outcome is described by the event ![\{ X_1 + X_2 = 12 \}](02347.jpeg). Assuming the dice are fair, this outcome has probability ![\textrm{Pr}(\{ X_1 + X_2 = 12\}) = \frac{1}{36}](02348.jpeg).

Probability theory is used all over the place, including in statistics, machine learning, quantum mechanics, and risk analysis.

###[Final words](part0010_split_003.md)

Throughout this book, I strived to equip you with the basic math tools you’ll need to make your future studies enjoyable and pain free. Remember to always take it easy. Never be afraid of math. Never take math exams too seriously. Play with math equations and try different approaches—the worst that can happen is you’ll need another piece of paper. Grades don’t matter. Big paycheques don’t matter. Never settle for a boring job just because it pays well, and try to work only on projects you truly care about.

Along the way, I want you to be confident in your ability to handle any complicated math that life might throw at you. You have the tools to do anything you want; choose your own adventure.

Chapter 6    

#[Chapter 6 Geometry](Geometry.md)

Geometry is the mathematical study of shapes and proportions. This branch of mathematics encompasses all things that can be drawn and analyzed using geometric concepts like similarity, proportionality, and orthogonality. Geometry studies the common, abstract nature of all geometrical shapes. For example, instead of studying and describing the properties of any particular triangle, we’ll study the geometrical properties common to all triangles.

We won’t just look at shapes; we’ll develop a language for describing them quantitatively in terms of lengths and angles. We can find patterns in different geometric shapes and describe proportions and lengths using equations.

Here’s the chapter breakdown. In[Section 6.1](part0006_split_001.md), we’ll discuss properties of several geometric shapes: triangles, circles, cylinders, spheres, cones, and pyramids. Sections[6.2](part0006_split_002.md) and[6.3](part0006_split_003.md) discuss the topic of _trigonometry_, which is the study of the proportions of the sides of right-angle triangles. We’ll learn all about the trigonometric functions ![\sin \theta](01118.jpeg) and ![\cos \theta](01119.jpeg), which play an important role in many areas of mathematics. In[Section 6.4](part0006_split_004.md) we’ll learn more about circles and _polar coordinates_. Sections[6.5](part0006_split_005.md),[6.6](part0006_split_006.md), and[6.7](part0006_split_007.md) will discuss the _ellipse_, the _parabola_, and the _hyperbola_, which are three other interesting geometric shapes that occur in nature.

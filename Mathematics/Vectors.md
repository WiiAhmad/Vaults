#[Chapter 7 Vectors](Vectors.md)

In this chapter we’ll learn how to manipulate multi-dimensional objects called vectors. Vectors are the precise way to describe directions in space. We need vectors in order to describe physical quantities like forces, velocities, and accelerations.

Vectors are built from ordinary numbers, which form the _components_ of the vector. You can think of a vector as a list of numbers, and _vector algebra_ as operations performed on the numbers in the list. Vectors can also be manipulated as geometric objects, represented by arrows in space. For instance, the arrow that corresponds to the vector ![\vec{v}=(v_x,v_y)](00645.jpeg) starts at the origin ![(0,0)](00923.jpeg) and ends at the point ![(v_x,v_y)](01519.jpeg). The word vector comes from the Latin _vehere_, which means _to carry_. Indeed, the vector ![\vec{v}](01520.jpeg) takes the point ![(0,0)](00923.jpeg) and carries it to the point ![(v_x,v_y)](01519.jpeg).

Figure 7.1: The vector ![\vec{v}=(3,2)](01522.jpeg) is an arrow in the Cartesian plane. The horizontal component of ![\vec{v}](01523.jpeg) is ![v_x=3](01524.jpeg) and the vertical component is ![v_y=2](01525.jpeg).

This chapter will introduce you to vectors, vector algebra, and vector operations, which are very useful for solving physics problems. What you’ll learn here applies more broadly to current problems in computer graphics, probability theory, machine learning, and other fields of science and mathematics. It’s all about vectors these days, so you’d best get to know them.

Figure 7.2: This figure illustrates the new concepts related to vectors. As you can see, there is quite a bit of new vocabulary to learn, but don’t be fazed—all these terms are just fancy ways of talking about arrows.

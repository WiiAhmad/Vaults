#[SymPy tutorial](part0010_split_018.md)

Computers can be very useful for dealing with complicated math expressions or when slogging through tedious calculations. Throughout this book we used `SymPy` to illustrate several math concepts. We’ll now review all the math tools available through the `SymPy` command line. Don’t worry if you’re not a computer person; we’ll only discuss concepts we covered in the book, and the computer commands we’ll learn are very similar to the math operations you’re already familiar with. This section also serves as a final review of the material covered in the book.

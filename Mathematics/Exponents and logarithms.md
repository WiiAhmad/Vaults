#[Chapter 3 Exponents and logarithms](./Exponents and logarithms.md)

Understanding exponents and logarithms is important for your math modelling skills. Exponential functions can describe population growth, interest calculations on loans, probabilities of random events, voltages in electric capacitors, radioactive decay, and many other phenomena.

The logarithmic function is the inverse of the exponential function. We need the logarithmic function every time we want to solve an equation containing exponents. Additionally, the logarithmic scale allows us to conveniently compare numbers of vastly different sizes. Logarithmic scales are used to describe systems with exponential scale differences, including sound intensity and the acidity of chemical solutions.

As a student of math, you can consider exponentiation and logarithm computation as basic operations, on the same footing as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

In this chapter, you’ll learn the basic rules for manipulating exponents and logarithms. As you read and practice, your job is to make sure you’re just as comfortable with exponents as you are with addition and multiplication, and as comfortable with logarithms as you are with subtraction and division.

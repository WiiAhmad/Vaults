This book is part of the **No Bullshit Guide** series of textbooks. These textbooks make the most important and useful science topics accessible to a general audience.

**No Bullshit Guide to Math & Physics**

Newton’s laws of physics form the best-known example of the scientific approach for understanding the physical world. Starting with a few basic principles, we can build accurate models for the motion of objects and the forces that exist between them. Calculus is the language of quantitative science. Many of the fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, biology, and economics are expressed in the language of calculus. A solid grasp of this subject is essential for anyone who wants to pursue studies in science, engineering, or business. This book combines math, mechanics, and calculus topics into a single tome. By learning calculus and mechanics at the same time, readers are able to better see the connections between the two subjects, and understand concepts on a deeper level. This combined, all-in-one book is ideal for adults who want to learn (or relearn) university-level math and physics topics.

**No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra**

Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear transformations. You need to know linear algebra to understand computer graphics, statistics, machine learning, quantum mechanics, and many other areas of science, business, and technology. This book offers a comprehensive guide to all aspects of linear algebra: computational, geometric, and theoretical. A sizeable part of the book is dedicated to the applications of linear algebra, including a chapter on quantum mechanics. This book will be of interest to undergraduate students taking a linear algebra course, graduate students who need a linear algebra review, programmers, data scientists, and anyone who’s interested in quantum mechanics.
